# CSC 372: Neural Networks

Welcome to my **CSC 372: Neural Networks** repository, part of the **Bachelor of Computer Science** program at **Tribhuvan University, Institute of Science and Technology (IOST)**.

## 📚 Course Overview

**Course Code:** CSC 372  
**Course Title:** Neural Networks  
**Institution:** Tribhuvan University, IOST  
**Semester:** Fifth Semester, Bachelor's Level

### Why Study Neural Networks?

Neural Networks, a core subset of Artificial Intelligence, are powerful computational models inspired by the human brain. They enable machines to learn from data, recognize patterns, and make predictions, forming the backbone of various modern AI applications such as:

- **Image and Speech Recognition:** Powering technologies like facial recognition and virtual assistants.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understanding and generating human language in chatbots and translation systems.
- **Autonomous Systems:** Driving decision-making in self-driving cars and robots.
- **Healthcare:** Assisting in medical diagnosis and personalized treatment plans.
- **Many other old and new emerging fields:**

Understanding Neural Networks is essential for anyone aspiring to build intelligent systems that can solve complex, real-world problems.
